## 🧠 Project Description

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course.  
The goal of the project is to build an **AI-powered Language Translator** that can translate text from one language to another using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  

The system is designed to:  
- Translate text between multiple languages  
- Detect source language automatically  
- Provide accurate and real-time translation  
- Log translations for future reference  

This project demonstrates how AI can remove communication barriers and make information globally accessible.
